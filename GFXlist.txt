Comments
========

This document was written by dax and is based on project with a similar purpose
by mvent2.

The idea was to document as much as possible and provide useful comments
regarding each GFX file exported by Lunar Magic.

This document is written in Markdown, which is a plain-text "tagless" markup
language for documents. It's supposed to be perfectly readable as is but with a
Markdown parser you get a little bit extra out of it.
