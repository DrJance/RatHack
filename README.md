# RatHack

This repo is for organizing the SMW rats nest collab hack and for sharing the relevant files and resources.

If you notice anything wrong, have any questions, or have any suggestions regarding the organization and
implementation, please reach out to DrJance on Discord or post in the rats nest or den.

# Important 

When sharing levels, do not upload .sfc files! Upload the .bps patch instead.



# Social Contract

We're aiming to build a coherent end product, which will likely require some level of compromise, and for
which we need some ground rules: if you're contributing to this collab, please 
  * be respectful to the other contributors;
  * come with an open mind, ready to hear and adapt to feedback;
  * give \*thoughtful\* feedback, and be gentle and constructive when doing so.

Some folks will have far more experience than others at any given aspect of hack creation, and that's okay!
  * If you're new to making hacks: this is a great opportunity to learn and ask questions.
  * If you're an expert: this is a great opportunity to teach (and probably learn some new things as well!).
  * If you already know one aspect really well, this is a great opportunity to fill both roles.

This is a "gates open, come on in" endeavor. So what "counts" as contribution is basically anything:
  * Designing or building a level
  * Designing or building parts of the overworld
  * Designing or building a new enemy/boss
  * Writing ASM
  * Transcribing or implementing music
  * Sprite and graphics work
  * Other miscellaneous Lunar Magic contributions (cutscenes, credits, etc.)
  * Playtesting
  * Helping others with tech problems
  * Iterative ideation
  * Other things unlisted but which should count
